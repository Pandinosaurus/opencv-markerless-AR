### Android version (not finished.)

I have tested the recognize part to the android platform. Using the version 2.4.9, I have to compiled the libnonfree.a from the opencv source. 

With Android NDK, the source have been compiled and running under my Android Phone, but too slow, so I continue the work with iPhone 5C (much better than my android phone).

### iOS version : 

also, with a video:

Under iphone 5c , the recognize process cost 50-80ms, tracking process cost 15-25ms.


BTW, I'm working on a Markless tracking project, video can be found:
